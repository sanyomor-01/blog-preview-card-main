## My process
- Card structured with semantic html tags
- Then proceeded with the styling using pure css


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned
I learnt the use of box-shadows and how it differs  from border-width. All these are applied in css styling
The box-shadow takes up 5 values, that's four length values and a color.
This the code snippest.

```html
<div>Some HTML code I'm proud of</div>
```
```css
.div {
  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
}
```
